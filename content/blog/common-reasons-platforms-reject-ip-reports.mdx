Even experienced teams face rejection cycles. Most are preventable with tighter process controls.

## Reason 1: Wrong claim category

Trademark, copyright, and impersonation are often routed differently.

## Reason 2: Weak ownership linkage

The report must clearly connect the submitter to the rights owner.

## Reason 3: Unstructured evidence

If evidence is not URL-specific, reviewers may not confirm the violation quickly.

```json
{
  "reportQualityChecks": {
    "claimCategoryConfirmed": true,
    "ownershipLinked": true,
    "urlLevelEvidence": true,
    "submissionLogCreated": true
  }
}
```

## Practical fixes

### Add pre-submission checks

Use a checklist gate before submission to reduce avoidable rejections.

### Standardize templates

A consistent template for claim language improves reviewer readability.

<Callout type="warning" title="Do not over-claim">
Avoid broad language such as "all listings are fake" without specific supporting evidence.
</Callout>

## FAQ

### Should we resubmit immediately after rejection?
Only after identifying the rejection reason and correcting supporting materials.

### Is one global template enough for all platforms?
No. Use a core template, then adapt fields to each platform's required policy format.

### Can acceptance rates improve quickly?
Yes, when teams enforce pre-submission quality controls and clear ownership references.
