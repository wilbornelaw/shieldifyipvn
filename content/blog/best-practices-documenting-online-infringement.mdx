Documentation quality determines whether a report is reviewable, reproducible, and escalation-ready.

## Capture complete page context

A cropped screenshot without URL context is often insufficient.

## Timestamp every critical artifact

Use UTC timestamps in filenames and status logs to align cross-team workflows.

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "url": "https://example.com/listing/123",
    "capturedAtUtc": "2026-01-02T08:14:00Z",
    "operator": "analyst-01",
    "evidenceType": "listing-screenshot"
  }
}
```

## Keep URL registry clean

### Minimum fields

- URL
- Platform
- Violation type
- Capture timestamp
- Current status

## FAQ

### Should we keep screenshots after takedown?
Yes. Retention supports trend analysis, recurrence tracking, and internal audit needs.

### Are browser exports enough?
Not always. Combine screenshots, URL logs, and submission records for completeness.

### Do timestamps need timezone normalization?
Yes. Standardize to UTC to avoid cross-team confusion.
