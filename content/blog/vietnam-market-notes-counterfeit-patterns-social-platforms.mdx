Vietnam-focused digital channels can move quickly, especially in social commerce campaigns.

## Pattern 1: Burst listing behavior

Counterfeit operators often publish multiple pages or listings in short windows to test enforcement gaps.

## Pattern 2: Identity mimic bundles

Brand names, product images, and support messaging are reused together to simulate legitimacy.

    "burstPublishing": true,
    "crossPageAssetReuse": true,
    "priceUndercutRange": "25-60%",
    "responsePriority": "high"
  }
}
```

## Pattern 3: Cross-channel redirection

Traffic may start on social pages and redirect to external chat, checkout, or cloned storefront flows.
