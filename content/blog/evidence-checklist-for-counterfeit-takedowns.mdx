Counterfeit takedowns often fail due to incomplete evidence packaging, not because the claim lacks merit.

<EvidenceChecklist items={[
  "Capture full listing URL and seller profile URL",
  "Record visible pricing and product images",
  "Save timestamped screenshots with page context",
  "Link claim to trademark or product authenticity references",
  "Track previous reports for recurring sellers"
]} />

## Build a repeatable evidence folder

Use a predictable folder structure so operations, compliance, and legal teams can review quickly.

```json
{
  "caseId": "CF-2026-041",
  "folders": [
    "01-urls",
    "02-screenshots",
    "03-ownership-references",
    "04-submission-records"
  ],
  "namingPattern": "{date}_{platform}_{seller}_{type}"
}
```

## Separate facts from assumptions

Only include observable facts in the evidence package. If authenticity is inferred, label it as a risk signal and not a final conclusion.

High-quality evidence should allow another reviewer to reproduce your findings without extra context.

## Maintain chain of updates

When cases evolve, append new entries rather than overwriting prior records. This preserves audit clarity.

Enforcement outcomes always depend on platform review policies and case context.

## FAQ

### Can one screenshot be enough?
Usually no. Use multiple captures showing URL, account identity, product detail, and claim context.

### Should we include customer complaints?
Yes, if available and relevant, but keep personal data handling compliant.

### Do we need legal language in every report?
Not always. Clear operational claims with strong evidence are often more effective at first submission.
