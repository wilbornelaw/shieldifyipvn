Many teams lose time because they report the right issue in the wrong policy lane.

## Define impersonation first

Impersonation usually involves pretending to be the brand, support staff, or executives.

## Define trademark misuse

Trademark misuse focuses on unauthorized use of protected marks in naming, listings, or promotion.

```json
{
  "decisionGuide": [
    {
      "signal": "Page claims to be official support",
      "route": "impersonation"
    },
    {
      "signal": "Seller uses protected brand name in listing",
      "route": "trademark"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Build a routing rule

### Rule example

- If identity deception is primary harm: submit impersonation report first
- If unauthorized mark use is primary harm: submit trademark report

<Callout type="info" title="Hybrid incidents are common">
Some cases need coordinated submissions in sequence. Start with the highest user-risk signal.
</Callout>

<Note>
Document the rationale for route selection. This improves internal consistency and reviewer handoffs.

## FAQ

### Can we submit both report types?
Yes, when both violations are present and evidence is clearly segmented.

### Which lane is faster?
Timing varies by platform and queue conditions; quality of evidence remains the key variable.

### Does this replace legal analysis?
No. This is operational guidance for platform reporting workflows.
