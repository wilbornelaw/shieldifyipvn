<Callout type="info" title="Use the correct policy lane">
Trademark abuse, impersonation, and counterfeit commerce can require different report paths. Choosing the wrong lane is a common cause of rejection.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Confirm ownership and authority

Before filing, prepare clear ownership references for the trademark and proof that the reporter is authorized to act.

- Trademark number and jurisdiction
- Brand owner legal name
- Internal contact record for enforcement requests

## Step 2: Capture URL-level evidence

Reports are easier to review when each claim maps to a specific URL and violation type.

```json
{
  "platform": "facebook",
  "claimType": "trademark",
  "asset": "word mark",
  "infringingUrls": [
    "https://facebook.com/example-page-1",
    "https://facebook.com/example-shop-2"
  ],
  "evidenceTimestamp": "2026-01-25T09:20:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Write concise claim statements

Use direct statements that tie the report to ownership and visible misuse. Avoid long legal narratives in initial submissions.

### Example statement structure

- Who owns the mark
- Where misuse appears
- Why the use is unauthorized

## Step 4: Submit and track outcomes

After submission, maintain a structured status tracker with report IDs, timestamps, and decisions.

<Note>
Status tracking is critical for recurring offenders. Good tracking improves future report quality and internal response speed.
